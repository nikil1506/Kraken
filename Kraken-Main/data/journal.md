Dragged myself out of bed, grabbed a disgustingly overpriced coffee, and tried to read a paper on SVM optimizations. I swear, some of these authors just write words to flex their vocabulary. Could barely understand half of it.

2025-02-08 11:45:00
Had a meeting with my advisor. It started off fine, then she hit me with the “so, how do you know your experiment is reproducible?” Uh, good question. I do not.

2025-02-08 14:00:00
Spent two painful hours debugging some stupid issue in my EEG preprocessing pipeline. Turns out, I was accidentally normalizing my data twice. TWO TIMES. No wonder my results looked like nonsense.

2025-02-08 17:30:00
Went for a walk because my brain was fried. Started questioning all my life choices. Why am I even doing this PhD? Could’ve been a barista, no stress, just vibes.

2025-02-08 21:15:00
Told myself I’d just quickly refactor my feature extraction script. Four hours later, I’m knee-deep in some unrelated research paper about transformers. How did I even get here?

2025-02-09 07:45:00
Forced myself to go for a run because apparently, exercise helps with stress. Felt good for exactly ten minutes before remembering I have a stack of unread papers waiting for me.

2025-02-09 10:30:00
Attended a seminar on deep learning interpretability. The speaker was great, but halfway through, my brain just noped out. Too much math, not enough coffee.

2025-02-09 13:00:00
Tried to run my model and immediately got hit with a TensorFlow version conflict. WHY does this happen every single time I update something? Spent an hour reinstalling dependencies like a clown.

2025-02-09 15:45:00
Finally, finally got my first somewhat decent classification results. Almost cried. Treated myself to an entire bag of chips.

2025-02-09 20:30:00
Sat down to write a progress report. Opened a blank document. Stared at it. Ended up doom-scrolling research Twitter instead. Classic.

2025-02-10 09:15:00
Started the day with some light reading on graph-based EEG analysis. By light, I mean painfully dense equations that made me reconsider my intelligence.

2025-02-10 11:30:00
Had a brilliant idea about normalizing coherence values differently. Jotted it down. Will probably forget about it by tomorrow.

2025-02-10 14:45:00
Helped a labmate fix a bug in their signal processing code. Felt like a genius for five minutes before going back to my own work and immediately breaking everything.

2025-02-10 17:00:00
Realized I haven’t backed up my results in weeks. Cue immediate panic. Spent the next 30 minutes manually saving files like my life depended on it.

2025-02-10 22:00:00
Watched a lecture on causality in ML. Understood approximately 30% of it. Brain is full. Time to sleep (aka lie in bed and overthink).

2025-02-11 08:00:00
Started strong, made some progress on feature selection… until I got distracted by a heated Reddit thread on AI ethics. Productivity: gone.

2025-02-11 12:30:00
Lab meeting turned into an unplanned debate on dataset bias. I argued passionately for a full 10 minutes before realizing I actually had no solid evidence to back my point. Oops.

2025-02-11 15:00:00
Tried writing the intro to my paper. Hated every word. Deleted half of it. Classic writing process.

2025-02-11 18:45:00
Realized I need to re-run my entire experiment because my dataset had mislabeled files. I love my life.

2025-02-11 23:15:00
Said “screw it” and played online chess instead of dealing with my problems. No regrets.

2025-02-12 09:30:00
Stared at my to-do list. Felt overwhelmed. Closed my to-do list.

2025-02-12 13:00:00
Finally restarted my experiment. Now praying my cluster doesn’t crash halfway through.

2025-02-12 16:00:00
Accidentally read a research paper completely outside my field. Now considering switching topics just to escape my current struggles.

2025-02-12 19:15:00
Tried explaining my research to a friend. Halfway through, I realized I don’t fully understand my research.

2025-02-12 22:30:00
Searched for a “quick fix” to improve my model. Ended up rewriting half my code instead. Classic.

2025-02-13 07:45:00
Woke up to an email from my advisor with way too many comments on my draft. Considered quitting academia.

2025-02-13 11:00:00
Spent the morning rewriting my methods section. Again. It still sucks.

2025-02-13 14:30:00
Forgot to eat lunch because I was debugging. Realized this when I started getting lightheaded.

2025-02-13 17:00:00
Attended a talk on explainable AI. Felt inspired for about 30 minutes, then promptly forgot everything.

2025-02-13 21:00:00
Tried implementing SHAP for my model. Got frustrated. Ended up watching cat videos instead.

2025-02-14 08:15:00
Woke up, had a minor existential crisis about my research direction, then moved on like nothing happened.

2025-02-14 10:45:00
Tried working from a café for a change. Accidentally eavesdropped on some dude pitching a startup. He said "AI-powered synergy" unironically.

2025-02-14 14:00:00
Tuning my SVM hyperparameters is like rolling a dice. Nothing makes sense. Just vibes.

2025-02-14 17:30:00
Had a brainstorming session with a labmate. Left with more confusion than answers.

2025-02-14 22:00:00
Started fixing one bug. Found five more. Send help.
