Woke up late, again. My sleep schedule is officially ruined.


Made coffee and grabbed a bagel. Thought about making eggs but was too lazy.


Started reviewing OS notes. Feeling behind, but at least I’m doing something.


Took a break. Could have done a quick workout, but instead, I just scrolled social media.


Lunch in my dorm. Sandwich and chips. Basic, but it works.


Group project meeting. Everyone’s stressed, and it’s not helping.


Back to studying. Finally got into the zone for a bit.


Got a text from my parents asking how I’m doing. Ignored it for now—I'll reply later.


Looked at my guitar for a few seconds. Haven’t touched it in weeks.


Brain completely shut down. Needed a reset.


Ordered takeout with my roommate. Real food for once.


Came back and forced myself to study. Making slow progress.


Break time. Ended up watching random YouTube videos for too long.


Checked emails and saw another OS exam reminder. Anxiety activated.


Roommate asked if I wanted to play FIFA. Said no this time.


Trying to sleep, but my mind won’t shut up.
