Woke up exhausted. I keep saying I’ll sleep earlier, but it never happens.


Coffee and a granola bar for breakfast. At this point, caffeine is my personality.


Walking to class, I realized I haven’t worked out all week. I keep saying I’ll go tomorrow, but I never do.


Operating Systems lecture. The professor dropped a ton of information, and my brain processed about 20% of it.


Quick break. Thought about studying, but I just scrolled through my phone instead.


Software Engineering class. Agile methodologies today. I zoned out for half of it.


Lunch with classmates. Someone brought up FIFA night, and I realized I haven’t played in forever.


Library session. Tried to study OS but got distracted reading random articles online.


Group project meeting. We’re behind schedule, which is stressing everyone out.


Got another missed lesson notification from my guitar instructor. I should really just cancel at this point.


Networking lecture. More subnetting. I get it in theory, but I need more practice.


Skipped the gym again. At this point, I should stop pretending I even go.


Instant noodles for dinner. The student life struggle is real.


Tried studying but ended up watching random YouTube videos. My discipline is falling apart.


Friends invited me to FIFA night. Said no at first, but then gave in. I needed a break.


Played FIFA for way longer than planned. Probably a mistake, but whatever.


Finally shutting my eyes. Hoping tomorrow is more productive.
