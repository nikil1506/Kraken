Woke up late, again. Need to fix this before the week starts.


Coffee and more OS notes. This exam is haunting me.


Tried solving practice problems. Some progress, but not enough.


Break time. Thought about working out. Didn’t.


Lunch in my dorm. Same as yesterday.


Another group project check-in. We’re still behind.


Studied for a while. Felt semi-productive.


Parents texted again. Replied this time.


Thought about playing guitar. Still didn’t.


Studied more. Losing focus.


Ordered food again. My diet is terrible.


Tried to study. Brain said no.


More procrastination. Need to stop.


Feeling the Sunday scaries.


Tried to cram more OS notes.
