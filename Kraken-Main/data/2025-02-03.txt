Woke up late, again. My sleep schedule is officially ruined.

Made coffee and grabbed a bagel. Thought about making eggs but was too lazy.

Started reviewing OS notes. Feeling behind, but at least I’m doing something.

Took a break. Could have done a quick workout, but instead, I just scrolled social media.

Lunch in my dorm. Sandwich and chips. Basic, but it works.

Group project meeting. Everyone’s stressed, and it’s not helping.

2025-02-03 14:30:00
Back to studying. Finally got into the zone for a bit.

2025-02-03 16:00:00
Got a text from my parents asking how I’m doing. Ignored it for now—I'll reply later.

Looked at my guitar for a few seconds. Haven’t touched it in weeks.

2025-02-03 17:00:00
Brain completely shut down. Needed a reset.

2025-02-03 18:00:00
Ordered takeout with my roommate. Real food for once.

2025-02-03 19:00:00
Came back and forced myself to study. Making slow progress.

2025-02-03 21:00:00
Break time. Ended up watching random YouTube videos for too long.

2025-02-03 22:00:00
Checked emails and saw another OS exam reminder. Anxiety activated.

2025-02-03 23:00:00
Roommate asked if I wanted to play FIFA. Said no this time.

Trying to sleep, but my mind won’t shut up.
